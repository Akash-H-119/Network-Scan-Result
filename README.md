# Network-Scan-Result
This report documents the results of a TCP SYN scan conducted on the local network 192.168.1.0/24 using Nmap. The scan identified 11 active hosts out of 256 possible addresses, detalling each device's IP address, MAC/vendor Information, and any open or filtered TCP ports.

-Objective:
To identify active hosts, discover open ports/services in a local network, and validate network traffic using deep packet inspection.

Steps Performed:

1.Environment Setup:

Installed Nmap on a workstation.

Determined the LAN IP range.



2.Active Host & Port Discovery:

Ran a TCP SYN scan:

nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24

Identified live devices and enumerated their open ports and services.

3.Packet Capture & Analysis with Wireshark:

Captured packets during the Nmap scan using Wireshark, saved as scanresult.pcap.

Key observations from the packet capture:

Visible SYN and SYN-ACK handshake patterns confirming Nmapâ€™s stealth scan behavior.

Clear mapping of hosts responding on ports such as HTTP(80), HTTPS(443), and SSH(22).

No anomalous or malicious packets beyond the intentional scan traffic.

Applied filters like:

tcp.flags.syn==1 and tcp.flags.ack==0

to isolate initial SYN packets, verifying the scanning methodology.


4.Risk Assessment & Findings:

Mapped services to potential vulnerabilities (e.g., outdated SSH versions).

Highlighted unnecessary open ports that could be hardened or firewalled.

-Outcome:

Delivered a combined network inventory and security posture snapshot:

List of live hosts and their exposed services.

Packet-level confirmation of the Nmap results.

Recommendations for closing or securing high-risk ports.

-Tools Used:

Nmap for host discovery and port scanning.

Wireshark for packet capture, protocol analysis, and scan verification.
